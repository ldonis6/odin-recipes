        <ul>
            <li>chicken, cut into serving pieces with skin and excess fat removed. </li>
            <li>heavy cream (Go for 35% cream. Don't try to cut calories by using half and half as it will curdle)</li>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>loroco buds (fresh or frozen)</li>
            <li>fresh garlic</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Thaw the frozen loroco and drain any excess moisture and blot dry with a paper towel. If you're using fresh loroco, wash it thoroughly and pat dry.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken pieces in a large pot with enough water to cover the chicken. Add salt.</li>
            <li>Cover, bring to a boil then reduce heat to medium and let simmer for 25 minutes or until cooked. Skim off any grey foam that might appear while cooking.</li>
            <li>Heat the butter in a large, deep skillet until melted. Add the finely-diced onion, chopped garlic, thinly sliced celery and leeks, chopped sweet red pepper, salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Add the bay leaf and fresh thyme leaves, cooking until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Pour the strained chicken broth into the skillet with the vegetables and heat to boiling. Reduce heat to medium and simmer.</li>
            <li>Add the heavy cream, stirring while pouring it into the skillet. Bring slowly to a simmer over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Return the chicken to the skillet and spoon the cream sauce over the chicken. Cover and simmer for five minutes until flavours merge. Adjust salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Garnish the pollo con loroco with red pepper slivers or sprigs of thyme. Serve with fluffy white rice and tortillas del comal.</li>
        </ol>
